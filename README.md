# MissionHacks
# we made two projects since we had time relating towards education. One Project is for helping teachers take attendance autonomously, and the other project is supposed to be a kit directed towards students in STEM engineering classes at school. A much more descriptive explaination of our project is on our website which is linked in the description of the repository.
