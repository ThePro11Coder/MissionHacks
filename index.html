        <p class="lead">The Autonomous Attendence Tracker is a an automated machine we built during the hackathon. The Machine is suppose to be a device where a student can say "here" into the microphone and with using the google API on the phone the program will add 1 to the the total number of students. When the teacher would like the program to end they can stop it which stops students from registering their attendance. The teacher then can see how many students were absent and check the classroom for absent students. In the future we plan on making a database where instead of the students saying "here" they can say their name and it will say they were present in the database and for the students that did not say their names would be marked absent. We were not able to complete this part because this was our second project we did and we ran out of time. This project helps the Education world as taking attendance could take a long time out of the the teachers lesson as they only get a limited amount of time to give a lesson. This could also help students get more time on tests as they do not need to wait for their teachers to take attendance and they could just walk in and take the test as many students fail tests as they are not able to finish. This autonomous machine was made with Arduino coding, with the Arduino computer application, and the Arduino Uno Board which is neccesary for Arduino coding. We had to order all the parts from different benders because none of the arduino had parts that supported the project we wanted to do. </p>

        <h2 class="featurette-heading">Self-Made Arduino Car Kit For Kids Education <span class="text-muted">Project #2, made with Arduino</span></h2>
        <p class="lead">Our autonomous arduino car has a plethora of features. It comes with a line tracer, a sensor for avoiding obstacles, and it is voice/ remote controlled. This car can be used as a building block for kids that are interested in the artificial intelligence field because it is simple and easy to make, but still provides a hands on experience that teaches the owner a lot about arduino. Many children that are interested in robotics do not know how to program all the functions. Our arduino car will allow children to program the car easily and have a sense of accomplishment. This will also help them learn the fundamentals of programming, since they are coding some of it themselves. Our kit will also teach children the principles of digital electronics because they are connecting pins together and using many different boards and ports to make this whole autonomous car work. We made this by adding two line tracking sensors in the back that will follow any line that is detected. After, we added an ultrasonic sensor so the car can avoid obstacles. Then we used a bluetooth module to get remote and voice control, so we will always have a backup option if the self driving does not work. </p>
